# IV42 - A Powerful Programable RPN Calculator for the DM42 Hardware based on FORTH

... coming soon

```
The DM42 calculator is a genuine device. A brilliant LCD display, good keys, a
USB disk and a powerful processor - all low powered by a single battery cell.
On the very stable operating system (DMCP) runs Free42 - a perfect simulator of
the legendary HP42 calculator. Using an 128-bit floating point library makes it
the "most precise calculator in the world".

As the DM42 is an "open system" it is possible to run other software on top of
the operating system (DMCP). And that is, where IV42 comes in. IV42 is a small,
fast, simple, convenient and powerful calculator that integrates to the DM42
hardware (primarily the keyboard layout) in an optimal way. There is no need for
particular key labels or stencils!

IV42 has a slightly different approach to operate a scientific RPN calculator:

First - IV42 is FORTH orientated. It operates a big stack (actual 26 registers
from A to Z). Main part of FORTH is the dictionary, an alphabetical sorted
list of all commands and user programs. By the way the name IV or IVEE stands
for the roman number 4, which was also a reason for naming FORTH (4th
generation of programming languages).

The second and most obvious difference is the (very) big number display. IV42
shows the top of the stack (TOS) in an unusual big design. So it is possible
to operate the calculator under very bad light conditions.

The third difference are the 18 (!) function keys (3 rows of 6 top keys). So
you can fast and easy access commands, physical constants, unit conversions,
user programs or even ascii characters.

The fourth difference is, that IV42 always calculates with complex numbers.
Aside from all functions it is even possible to handle complex matrices or
complex hexadecimal numbers.

The fifth mentionable difference is the use of an exclusive ON/OFF key (EXIT)
like HP used it for the voyager series.

In addition IV42 offers of course many features like the original calculator:
* Programming (edit or load/save user programs from/to USB disk)
* Calculus (value, slope, root, integral, plot of a function)
* Physical constants (CODATA)
* Useful conversion functions
* Assignable function keys
* Hexadecimal numbers
* Matrices
* Statistics, line best fit, probabilities, normal distribution
* ...

Have fun!
